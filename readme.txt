This map is based on texx survival extreme desert v3

Because GPG could no longer handle the updates in the vault look in the map title for the version
I am still learning the scipt file so there could be some unexpected behaviours.

Initial Version has Label v1
- the map is currently what I call alpha version

v2
new waypoints
remove the some unneccessary decals
some radars to the final gates


v2.3
removed scatis completly
removed specials completly
move the 2 outer allies a little bit more to the side

todos:
 balance
 waypoints
 wave designs
 map layout and design
